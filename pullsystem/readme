pull /system from phone and create yaffs2 image,
keep permissions and ownership

list of files/dirs that cannot be pulled will be stored
in system.log.<datetime>

usage: fakeroot make [targets] [variables assignement] ...

supported targets:
help  # this screen
tar   # make tarboll; needs only fakeroot and adb
image # make image and tarboll; needs also mkyaffs2image

fakeroot can be installed from your distro repository

this script also needs "adb" from dalvik/linux sdk

optionally (for building target "image")
this script also needs "mkyaffs2image" from dalvik/linux sdk

to obtain and setup dalvik/linux sdk, follow one of these links:
1. http://developer.android.com/sdk/
smaller downloads, but contains blobs
2. http://source.android.com/source/initializing.html
much larger downloads, but only free software

hints about sdk stuffs:
follow above instruction and after running "lunch ..." just
run "make adb mkyaffs2image" to build adb and mkyaffs2image

if you don't wont/can change your $$PATH,
 you can specify paths to abf and/or mkyaffs2image:
fakeroot make adb=/full/path/to/adb mkyaffs=/full/path/to/mkyaffs2image ...

if you have more than one device connected (see output of "adb devices")
you should specify your device serial with "device=...":
fakeroot make device=your_device_serial ...
